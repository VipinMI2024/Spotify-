Spotify Clone

Overview
The Spotify Clone is a front-end web project that replicates the user interface of the Spotify music streaming platform. Built using HTML and CSS, this project showcases a responsive design with a music player interface, navigation icons, and card-based layouts for playlists or albums. It serves as a practice project to demonstrate web development skills in creating visually engaging interfaces.
Features

Responsive Design: Mimics Spotify's layout with a sidebar, music player bar, and card-based content.
Custom Styling: Uses CSS to style elements like buttons, icons, and cards.
Image Assets: Includes icons (e.g., play, forward, library) and card images for a realistic look.
Static Interface: Provides a static front-end UI without backend functionality.
